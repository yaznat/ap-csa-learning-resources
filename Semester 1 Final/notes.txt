A couple of things to remember for the final:



  Import Random by typing Random (capital R), hover over the red, 
  hit quick fix, hit import Random

  !!! Use r.nextInt by creating a private Random variable in the class:
        private Random r = new Random();

  r.nextInt(num) returns a random number from 0 to num - 1. 

  To create a different range, add a number to it:
    For example: a six sided die is r.nextInt(6) + 1

  

  When making a for i loop, either do:
    
    i = 0 and i < number

    OR

    i = 1 and i <= number

  You can always count out iterations on your fingers to relearn this.



  To debug your individual methods, first make sure they are "public" and not "private."

  Then, in a main method, create an object of the class they are in:
    For example: Game g = new Game();

  Finally, print g.*name_of_method* to the terminal to see what it returns.
